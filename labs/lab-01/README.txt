Lab-01 Reflection

First of all, I'm sorry for doing this so late. Things have been impacting me in my personal life and I'm trying my best to pick up the slack in this course.
This assignment was very entertaining and I can't wait to complete the other two labs(#2,#3) and then Project 1 for my own Story Adventure Game. I'm currently doing Mobile Labs as well
and the course has similar formatting and coding styles as this course from what I could tell.
